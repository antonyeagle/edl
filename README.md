*Elements of Deductive Logic*, an open-source intermediate logic textbook. The book covers the basics of formal logic and elementary metatheory. Its distinguishing feature is that it has more emphasis on metatheory than comparable introductory textbooks. It was originally written to accompany lectures in the introductory-intermediate logic course at the University of Oxford of the same name.
