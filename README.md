*Elements of Deductive Logic*, an open-source intermediate logic textbook. The book covers the basics of formal logic and elementary metatheory. Its distinguishing feature is that it has more emphasis on metatheory than comparable introductory textbooks. It was originally written to accompany lectures in the introductory-intermediate logic course at the University of Oxford of the same name.

This version is **in progress**. Chapters 1–7 (with the exception of §7.7), and §15.1, have been fully revised as of May 2017. Other chapters are scheduled for creation or substantial revision during the first half of 2017, though some of the material on modal logic and many-valued logic, newly introduced, will likely not be finalised for some time.
